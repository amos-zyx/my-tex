  abstract = {This book introduces finite difference methods for both ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and partial differential equations (PDEs) and discusses the similarities and differences between algorithm design and stability analysis for different types of equations. A unified view of stability theory for ODEs and PDEs is presented, and the interplay between ODE and PDE analysis ..., (展开全部)},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a verification method for the convergence rates of the numerical solutions for parabolic equations. Specifically, we consider the numerical convergence rates of the heat equation, the Allen\textendash Cahn equation, and the Cahn\textendash Hilliard equation. Convergence test results show that if we refine the spatial and temporal steps at the same time, then we have the second-order convergence rate for the second-order scheme. However, in the case of the first-order in time and the second-order in space scheme, we may have the first-order or the second-order convergence rates depending on starting spatial and temporal step sizes. Therefore, for a rigorous numerical convergence test, we need to perform the spatial and the temporal convergence tests separately.},
